# Brain tumour and Segmentation

In this project several pretrained networks and proposed models were experemented on to classify the brain tumour into 4 classes. The best pretrained network performance has  been merged with a proposed neural network that uses multi-head attention mechanism. The base model is used as well with segmentation task.
